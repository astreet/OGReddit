Installing
----------

1. Check out the project with git: git://github.com/astreet/OGReddit.git
2. Go to chrome://extensions and check 'Developer mode'
3. 'Load unpacked extension...' and choose the extension dir from the checkout
4. Visit reddit and let me know if you have problems!

Please excuse the shitty code quality, this has gone through a bunch of iterations.  I'll clean it up before launch.
